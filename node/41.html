We have a <a href="../sites/hoc.ilr.cornell.edu/files/shared/HOC-Camp-Informational-Flyer-2016.pdf">delightful flyer</a>. Please share it around!</p><p><strong>How much does camp cost?</strong></p><p>It is a very reasonable price for two weeks of learning, eating, and friendship. We have added options for double-occupancy rooms and no housing. We suggest checking craigslist or airbnb.com to find alternative local accomodations.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>&nbsp;</p></th><th><p>Single</p></th><th><p>Double</p></th><th><p>No Housing</p></th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Faculty</strong></p></td><td><p>3000</p></td><td><p>2700</p></td><td><p>2300</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Graduate Student</strong></p></td><td><p>1500</p></td><td><p>1200</p></td><td><p>900</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does the camp include?</strong></p><p>The camp includes all instruction and materials (including software), as well as breakfast, lunch, and housing (see above).</p><p>It does not include transportation costs or dinner.</p><p><strong>When is the application deadline?</strong></p><p>January 31, 2018</p><p><strong>When is the camp?</strong></p><p>It is usually in the middle two weeks of July.</p><p>In 2018, it will be from July 8 to July 20. (Campers arrive on the 8th, but sessions start on the 11th. Similarly, the last session is on July 20and everybody leaves on the 21st).</p><p><strong>I am a VAP or an adjunct or am in some other way a precarious academic and don&#39;t have access to departmental resources. What do I pay?</strong></p><p>We can work something out (usually charging you like a grad student), but ask that you send an email explaining your situation ahead of time. We are sensitive to the inequities of the tenure system and the lotteries of the academic market.</p><p><strong>Where do I send my essay?</strong></p><p>There is no essay.</p><p><strong>Where do I send my letters from famous historians?</strong></p><p>First of all, no historians are famous. Second, there are no letters.</p><p><strong>I have a Ph.D. in economics. Should I come?</strong></p><p>No. This camp is not to teach you how to become a historian.</p><p><strong>I do literature/anthropology/sociology/art history but I want to learn how to apply these methods to my field. Should I come?</strong></p><p>Yes. A few people in allied humanities and qualitative social science fields come every year and enrich the conversation.</p><p><strong>How are campers selected?</strong></p><p>We look for a good fit between your project and what the camp offers. If you seem to already know everything that we teach, then that spot should go to somebody who would benefit more. We are very open to people who want to expand their proverbial wheelhouse.</p><p><strong>I am an undergrad or recent undergraduate and want to bolster my chances for graduate school admission. Should I come?</strong></p><p>No. We currently only accept graduate students, faculty, and historical professionals (like archivists). Please check back once you are in a program. We can&#39;t wait to meet you.</p><p><strong>How much does the camp cost?</strong></p><p>See above!</p><p><strong>Why does it cost so much?</strong></p><p>Paying economists to compress a semester&#39;s worth of ideas into a one day mega seminar that runs from 9 am to 6 pm costs money! Also Cornell charges us for the rooms and the food.</p><p>The main cost, however, is housing. We are still trying to figure out whether there is a better system for that. If you have ideas, drop a line.</p><p>We have added more housing options to lower prices for those who want more options.</p><p>We encourage everyone to reach out to their advisors (grad students) or department chairs (faculty) to see about financial support from their institutions. Usually somebody finds somebody the money.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.8px;">Why does it cost so little?</strong></p><p>Compared to other professional training programs, this seems very inexpensive. We keep costs down by not paying the director, applying for grants, and generally being scrappy.</p><p>If you, your professional organization, or somebody else would like to donate money, please be in touch!</p><p><strong>How do graduate students and faculty afford that?</strong></p><p>Usually they get their departments to pay for it. Ask your advisor or department chair.</p><p><strong>Will I be reading Marx and Smith?</strong></p><p>No. This camp is all about the <strike>boring</strike> necessary stuff that now you wish you knew, like accounting, economics and data analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Will I be reading historiography and theory?</strong></p><p>Again, no. You will be doing problem sets. You already know how to do that other stuff, silly.</p><p><strong>Will we be reading history?</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t you already know how to do that? Here is a <a href="https://networks.h-net.org/node/GROUP_NID/blog/resource-blog/81875/history-capitalism-reading-list">list to get you started.</a></p><p><strong>Will I learn to use Excel?</strong></p><p>Like a boss.</p><p><strong>Will I learn how to map data?</strong></p><p>For sure. And we will also be doing calculations on those maps.</p><p><strong>I want to talk with people who actually do this. How will you make that happen?</strong></p><p>We will be Skyping with archivists from big corporations and famous librarians to talk about doing research there (and how to get grants!). We will also be skyping with historians (that you probably read for your oral exams) that will talk about how these use these methods in their own work.</p><p><strong>I am suspicious of the universalist claims of economics. Why should I come?</strong></p><p>We are too, but you should still come, because you need to better understand what they are really saying so that you can engage with a broader world. It is time to get literate in the languages of power.</p><p><strong>I don&rsquo;t want to learn math. I want to learn how the economy works. </strong></p><p>We do too. Some (basic) math is necessary to understanding how the economy works, however. We will also be covering many varieties of economic institutions.</p><p><strong>This camp sounds presentist. Is it?</strong></p><p>Yes. The idea is that you learn contemporary thinking and techniques, which gives you a stable foundation to allow you to historicize concepts. Understanding financial accounting today makes it much easier to understand slave accounting in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Understanding the weighted-average cost of capital today allows you to examine risk decisions in the 18<sup>th</sup> century more clearly. I promise.</p><p>It is also presentist in the belief that to engage with policymakers today you will need to learn their language. This camp will empower you to more powerfully intervene in the world.</p><p><strong>I don&rsquo;t study 20<sup>th</sup> century U.S. history, should I still come?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Campers have used their skills to study all regions of the world and all time periods (even ancient history!).</p><p><strong>Will I be debating how these methods will reshape the kinds of questions I can ask in historical research?</strong></p><p>Yes. All the time. Especially over beer. It is a collective experience. Watch <a href="http://youtu.be/TcGCYdCWwH0">this video</a> (which is about a <a href="http://hoc.ilr.cornell.edu/november-2014-conference">conference</a>, but has some campers talk about how the experience changed their work.)</p><p><strong>Will I make friends? I have a fear of summer camp.</strong></p><p>Everybody is a history nerd here and you will feel the love. There are no required sports.</p><p><strong>Do I need a laptop?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p>The course uses a lot of software. You should be comfortable installing software (like dropbox) and how to use your operating system to find files. We expect a basic level of computer literacy. It is 2018 and we are already living in the future.</p><p><strong>Will there be some prework to get me up to speed? I am super nervous about math.</strong></p><p>Nearly everybody at the camp has some anxiety about math. We have a well-trod prework program in accounting and math that will get you up to speed. Everybody marvels at what they are now capable of doing. It is super straightforward.</p><p><strong>No. For real. I am super nervous about math.</strong></p><p>You can read Derrida. I assure you that statistics is easier. Millions of people learn it every year. You can too.</p><p><strong>What will math tell me?</strong></p><p>By the end of the camp, you will be able to analyze why firms&#39; fail through their account books, what the asset value of being white was in 1955, and how central banks actually control the economy. Plus so, so much more. Also, did I mention new equally nerdy friends?</p><p>Also you get a t-shirt.</p><p><strong>Will this be fun?</strong></p><p>More than you ever would have thought.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
